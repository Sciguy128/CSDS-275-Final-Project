# CSDS 275 Final Project - Towers of Hanoi Robot
## By Aidan Leblanc, David Kraus, Gentiana Deda, Oneal Egwuatu, Qitai Huang

### Roles on jobs that of team memebers
- Aidan: Group organizer and designer of robot and robot enviroment. Also computed the inverse kinematics of the robots
- David: Designed the manipulator and compiled code and videos into the github repository
- Gentiana: Created rings for the robot to manipulate, and worked on the robot path planning
- Oneal: Was part of the team that created the code that allowed the manipulator to grab onto the rings
- Qitai: Was part of the team that created the code that allowed the manipulator to grab onto the rings

### Introduction
The idea behind this project was to design and develope a robot that could play the puzzle game of towers of hanoi.  

Through putting together and codeing this robot, we can explore a number of different topics including but not limited to:  

Inverse kinimatics, Rigid body transformation matrices, Using a Jacobian to trnasfrom from joint spce to task space, Implementing a method to manipulated/grab 
objects in CopelliaSim.  

We eventually want to demonstrate a robot that can pick up rings and set them down onto another tower much similar to the robot in the figure below

### Approach
We design a static robot that would have the ability to pick up the rings and move them onto the right towers.
